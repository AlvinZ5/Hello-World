## **Description**

Description for Water Softner System Trend Analysis
* Limitation of authority

Description for Fraud In Auto Insurance
* Auto insurance fraud is a problem we need to pay attention to, so our group's business goal for this report is to help auto insurance companies identify the features related to auto insurance fraud and provide a good, predictable fraud model to reduce the financial loss of auto insurance companies and indirectly help them grow their customerâ€™s base. Our group analyzed data from previous auto insurance fraud to achieve our business goal. Our data mining goal is to predict whether old customers or new customers will have the auto insurance fraud issue in future. We will ultimately decide which model will be the best predictive model for auto insurance fraud.


## **How to Run Program**
Here shows how would run the program and what files need to be available:
*New cleaned model without Y Data Mining Dataset.*
    - New cleaned model without Y Data Mining Dataset.rattle
    - filename1.csv
